# apalike-zotero

This zotero citation style attempts to copy the apalike style from natbib. I creted this for the [ALIFE XVI](http://xva.life/) which seems to be using the same citation that [MitPress](https://mitpress.mit.edu/) uses.

The original citation style is called apalike and belongs to the Latex package [natbib](http://merkel.zoneo.net/Latex/natbib.php). I based `apalike-zotero` in the American Psychological Association 6th Edition available in the [Zotero style repositories](https://www.zotero.org/styles), and I used the [Visual Editor](http://editor.citationstyles.org/visualEditor/) to produce the `apalike.csl` file.

Installation
----------------

You just need to open the Preferences (In Firefox) for Zotero, in Cite and and Add the file with the '+' button. 

Or just Google how to add a citation style from file .csl in Zotero.

It might send a warning regarding the standards. I really have no idea of what it is and that is why I am not trying to upload it to the Zotero official repo.
