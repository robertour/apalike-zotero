# apalike-zotero

This Zotero citation style attempts to copy the apalike style from natbib. I created this for the [ALIFE XVI](http://xva.life/), which seems to be using the same citation that [MitPress](https://mitpress.mit.edu/) uses.

The original citation style is called apalike and belongs to the Latex package [natbib](http://merkel.zoneo.net/Latex/natbib.php). I based `apalike-zotero` in the American Psychological Association 6th Edition available in the [Zotero style repositories](https://www.zotero.org/styles), and I used the [Visual Editor](http://editor.citationstyles.org/visualEditor/) to produce the `apalike.csl` file.

Installation
------------

You need to open the Preferences (In Firefox) for Zotero, in Cite, and Add the file with the '+' button. 

Or just Google how to add a citation style from file .csl in Zotero.
